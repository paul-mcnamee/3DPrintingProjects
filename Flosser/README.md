# Mega Ultra Spool Flosser 9001

## Description

This was designed to eliminate the plastic waste associated with the disposable flossers. I wanted a spool of floss that I could wrap around a reusable flosser. This is what I came up with after a few weeks of thinking and several design and print session in my spare time.

## Disclaimer / finishing

The part should be finished with a food safe finish since you're putting it in your mouth. As always, make sure your printer, filament, and finish materials are food safe, I am not responsible or liable for any of your actions.

## Printing

The current iteration of the design requires Sheath v13 and spool v17 which includes a simpler screw mechanism. I printed the parts on the Ender 3 printer using 0.2mm layer height. Please contact for full print settings.

## Usage

1. For usage, start by threading the floss from your container of floss through the top hole of the sheath.
2. Hold the end of the floss on the spool and then wrap as much floss as you would like around the spool, but be sure you can still insert the spool into the sheath and there is clearance for the floss to unwind.
3. Insert the spool back into the sheath and screw it together.
4. Cut the floss away from the container of floss.
5. Pull out about 2 finger lengths of floss from the newly wrapped spool
6. Wrap the floss around the pins on one side of the sheath in a figure 8 pattern to lock it in place.
7. Pull the floss over the top of the flosser and seat the floss in the grooves in the top arms coming off of the sheath.
8. Pull the floss taught and wrap the loose end around the sheath handle
9. Floss

If the floss comes loose, you may want to use a thinner floss, or you may also want to hold the end of the floss instead of wrapping it around the sheath.

## Future design considerations

1. I am still thinking of ways to implement a cutter for the floss though, currently I am just using the one from the container of floss I had already. 
2. Sturdier support structure for the arms, they are a bit flimsy and maybe attaching them to the main cyllindrical body would add some rigidity
